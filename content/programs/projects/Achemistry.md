## Alchemistry

Alchemistry is a collaborative, ever-changing community dedicated to advancing the science and practice of molecular free energy calculations. Its members represent a diverse cross-section of academia and industry, united by a shared goal: to introduce the latest and greatest in computational free energy methods.

Each year, Alchemistry organizes the Workshop on Free Energy Methods in Drug Design, a meeting that convenes experts from across academia and industry to discuss advances in theory, computation, and application. The workshop provides a forum for exploring algorithmic innovations, benchmarking efforts, and real-world case studies that demonstrate how free energy methods can accelerate pharmaceutical research. Through talks, tutorials, and community discussions, participants help shape the next generation of molecular simulation tools and standards.

Materials from past workshops are freely available through the Alchemistry website, offering a lasting educational resource for the global molecular simulation community. This open archive extends the reach of the event, ensuring that its insights continue to inform and inspire researchers long after each meeting concludes. 

Registration for the Free Energy Workshop can also be found at the website! Reach out to <alchemistry@omsf.io> for any inquiries.
