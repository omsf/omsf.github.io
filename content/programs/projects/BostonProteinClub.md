## Boston Protein Design and Modeling Club

The Boston Protein Design and Modeling Club is a collaborative community of researchers, students, and professionals discussing advances at the frontier of computational protein science. Based in Boston, one of the world’s leading hubs for biotechnology and academia, the club provides a forum for sharing ideas, presenting research, and fostering cross-institutional collaboration across the broad landscape of protein design, modeling, and simulation.

At its core, the BPDMC is dedicated to the principle that open exchange accelerates discovery. By bringing together experts from academia and industry, the club creates a space for constructive dialogue on the latest innovations in computational biology—from algorithmic breakthroughs and biophysical modeling to machine learning–driven design and experimental validation, all against the backdrop of free pizza.

And if you can't make the meetings, BPDMC maintains an active YouTube channel, featuring recordings of all past presentations. Each talk is freely available to the public, providing a comprehensive archive of research and discussion across computational and experimental protein science. The channel serves as a resource for students, researchers, and practitioners interested in the latest advances in protein design and modeling.
