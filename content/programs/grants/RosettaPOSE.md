### NSF POSE Phase II: Transitioning Rosetta Commons to a self-sustainable Open Source Ecosystem

The NSF POSE Phase II grant supports the transition of Rosetta Commons toward a fully open-source ecosystem, modernizing governance, licensing, and operational structures to enable broader collaboration across the Rosetta ecosystem. Building on earlier strategic work, the initiative focuses on developing shared standards, improving interoperability with emerging tools, and establishing sustainable infrastructure for community-driven software development. The project aims to strengthen long-term sustainability of the Rosetta software suite, expand contributor participation in the developement of Rosetta software, and advance open scientific infrastructure standards.
