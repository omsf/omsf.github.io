The Open Molecular Software Foundation (OMSF) builds open-source infrastructure and tooling for computational molecular science. We’re looking for a **UX Engineer** who can ship **polished, usable web experiences**, especially where the UI is powered by **interactive scientific visualization**. We are offering a 6-8 month contract with an hourly rate determined based on the contractor’s experience and agreed upon project deliverables. We expect approximately 15-20 h per week for this project. The contractor will need to be based in the United States. 

All work in this engagement will be released under the **MIT License**.

### What you’ll work on

You’ll help us build a set of reusable visualization components for the software in our ecosystem, plus a few web interfaces that consume them. 

**Reusable components**

The reusable components you’ll help build will manage the plumbing between our existing Python tooling and Javascript tools for visualization. The reusable components should be as framework-agnostic as possible, with the intent that they will be easy for other developers to incorporate into their own applications. Components we are considering include:

* 3D protein-ligand complex visualization: Connect molecular representations from OMSF projects to a visualization tool such as Mol\* or 3Dmol.  
* 3D small molecule visualization: Closely related to the protein-ligand visualization, but focused on interactivity with the small molecule in particular.  
* Task progress visualization: Connect our task progress backend to graph visualization libraries such as Cytoscape or vis.js network.  
* Alchemical network visualization: This combines a network visualization component (similar to the task progress) with the small molecule visualization component to illustrate how a tool like [Open Free Energy](https://openfree.energy) transforms molecules as part of its scientific work.

**Web interfaces**

You’ll also work with our backend developers to put together simple web-based interfaces for small scale compute. These will act as a showcase of the reusable components, and you’ll also help us set up a good input interface. Web interfaces we’re considering include:

* Protein structure prediction using [OpenFold](https://openfold.io/)  
* Small molecular parametrization using [Open Force Field](https://openforcefield.org)  
* Atom mapping for transformations using [Open Free Energy](https://openfree.energy)

### You might be a good fit if you…

* Build modern web UIs comfortably in **TypeScript** that interface with backends written in **Python**  
* Have experience developing front-ends that interface with **serverless cloud** backends  
* Are comfortable collaborating on platforms such as **GitHub**  
* Like to write readable, easy-to-browse **documentation** for the tools you build  
* Can do pragmatic technical research: compare options, prototype, recommend, and then ship  
* Enjoy collaborating in the open: clear PRs, good commit messages, iterative review

### Engagement Details

* Contract basis: hours/week are flexible; although this particular contract has a hard stop after September 2026\.  
* Fully remote: OMSF is a remote organization. Most work is asynchronous, with occasional synchronous check-ins at times friendly for continental US time zones.
