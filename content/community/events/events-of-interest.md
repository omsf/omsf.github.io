Join OMSF Monthly Office Hours

Every month, the Open Molecular Software Foundation hosts an open community call for researchers, developers, and project leads to connect around software, science, and project management best practices.

Each session features short presentations from subject-matter experts, followed by open discussion and Q&A. Topics span technical workflows, collaborative tools, and lessons learned from real-world research projects - always with an emphasis on practical, actionable insights you can apply in your own work.

Whether you’re an early-career professional, graduate student, postdoc, or simply curious about how software and science intersect, our office hours are a chance to learn from experts, explore tools and approaches that accelerate research and share your own challenges and ideas with a welcoming community.

Free to attend · Held monthly via Zoom · Everyone welcome
