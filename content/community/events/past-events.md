**OMSF Symposium 2025**

Our third symposium took place in Boston, MA on May 9th at the legendary Museum of Science. With a wonderful view of the Charles as our background, OMSF25 was a perfect opportunity for our community of staff, academics, and industry partners to come together under one roof, share the latest advancements, and grow as a community.

### OMSF Symposium 2024

OMSF Symposium 2024 was in Leiden, NL. It was fantastic to see our community gathered under one roof, especially one as beautiful as [Naturalis](https://www.naturalis.nl/) - an unforgettable experience!

If you missed the event this year or want to revisit it, we now have photos and videos available! The symposium featured a blend of keynote presentations, partner presentations, engaging panel discussions, and hands-on project demos from leading initiatives like Open Force Field, Open Free Energy, and OpenFold.
