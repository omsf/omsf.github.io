### OMSF Symposium 2025

In May of 2025, OMSF gathered at the Museum of Science in Boston, MA for our third annual symposium!

We brought together our community for a day focused on project progress and real-world applications. Talks spanned OMSF-hosted software projects, industry perspectives from organizations using these tools in production settings, and exposes from across our ecosystem.

### OMSF Symposium 2024

Our second symposium was in Leiden, NL. It was fantastic to see our community gathered under one roof, especially one as beautiful as [Naturalis](https://www.naturalis.nl/) - an unforgettable experience!

The symposium featured a blend of keynote presentations, partner presentations, engaging panel discussions, and hands-on project demos from leading initiatives like Open Force Field, Open Free Energy, and OpenFold. 

Here is the [itinerary](https://omsf.notion.site/OMSF-Symposium-2024-077c73e9d80a4a0ba01fcbafd20885fa?pvs=74) of the event.
